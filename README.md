# Iris-ML-Web-Project-Beginner
A basic introduction to how to integrate ml with web development. <br>
The web app takes input and shows output in return<br>
For this we have used the well known IRIS dataset with parameters as Sepal length and Sepal Width and Petal length and Petal width<br>
SVC is used for prediction<br>
For the app, we have used Flask as backend<br>
